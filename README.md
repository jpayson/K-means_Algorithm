# k-means-algorithm
An implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm performed on a dataset of the life expectancies and birth rates of countries in 1953 and 2008.

Written in Python 3.7.4; requires the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

To use, simply run kmeans.py and follow the text prompts to choose a dataset, the number of clusters to divide the dataset into, and the number of iterations that should be run. A scatter plot will display a visual representation of the clusters, and details on the contents and averages of each cluster will be printed to the console.
